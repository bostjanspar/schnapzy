Schnapzy: The Card Duel

# Schnapsen - Traditional Austrian Card Game

Schnapsen is a classic two-player point-trick card game from the Marriage family, originating in Austria. The objective is to be the first player to score 66 card points through winning tricks and melding marriages (King-Queen pairs).

## Game Overview

- **Players:** 2
- **Deck:** 20 cards (Ace, Ten, King, Queen, Jack in each suit)
- **Objective:** Score 66 card points to win a hand; first to reach 0 game points wins
- **Starting Score:** Both players begin at 7 game points and subtract points won

## What Makes Schnapsen Unique

- **Flexible play phase:** No requirement to follow suit while the talon (draw pile) remains open
- **Mental scorekeeping:** Players must track scores in their heads—no writing allowed
- **Strategic closing:** Players can close the talon to force strict play and race to 66 points
- **High stakes:** Incorrect claims result in penalties, and games can swing dramatically

## Card Values

| Card | Point Value |
|------|-------------|
| Ace  | 11 |
| Ten  | 10 |
| King | 4 |
| Queen | 3 |
| Jack | 2 |

**Total points in deck:** 120

## Setup

1. Determine dealer (alternate after each hand)
2. Deal 3 cards to each player
3. Turn up one card for trump
4. Deal 2 more cards to each player (5 cards total)
5. Place remaining cards face-down crosswise on trump card (talon)

## Gameplay Phases

### Phase 1: Open Talon (Trick-and-Draw)

**Leading:** Non-dealer leads first, then trick winners lead

**Playing cards:**
- No requirement to follow suit or trump
- Highest card of led suit wins, or highest trump

**After each trick:**
1. Winner counts card points from the trick
2. Winner draws top card from talon
3. Loser draws next card
4. Winner leads to next trick

### Phase 2: Closed/Exhausted Talon (Strict Play)

Once the talon is closed or exhausted, strict rules apply:

**When non-trump is led:**
- Follow suit with higher card if possible
- Otherwise play lower card of same suit
- If unable to follow suit, must trump
- If no trumps, play any card

**When trump is led:**
- Play higher trump if possible
- Otherwise play lower trump
- If no trumps, play any card

## Special Actions

### Trump Jack Exchange
- The Jack of trumps can be swapped for the face-up trump card
- Only when you have the lead and before playing to the trick
- Only while talon is open and unclosed

### Marriages (Melds)
- Declare King-Queen of same suit when leading
- **Plain marriage:** 20 points
- **Royal marriage (trumps):** 40 points
- Show both cards, lead one to the trick
- Points only count after you've won at least one trick
- Can still be declared after talon is closed

### Closing the Talon
- Flip trump card face-down on talon when you have the lead
- Commits you to reaching 66 with only your current cards
- Triggers strict play rules immediately
- **Cannot close when only 2 cards remain in talon**
- Can exchange trump Jack and close on the same turn

## Winning a Hand

### Going Out (Declaring 66)
- Claim victory immediately after winning a trick or declaring a marriage
- Play stops and points are verified

**If claim is correct, you score:**
- **1 game point:** Opponent has 33+ points
- **2 game points:** Opponent has <33 points but won a trick (Schneider)
- **3 game points:** Opponent won no tricks (Schwarz)

**If claim is wrong:**
- Opponent scores 2 game points (or 3 if they had no tricks)

### Closing Player Scoring
When the talon was closed, scoring is based on opponent's status at the moment of closing:
- 1 point: Opponent had 33+ card points
- 2 points: Opponent had a trick but <33 points
- 3 points: Opponent had no tricks

**Closing penalties:**
- If closer fails to reach 66: Opponent gets 2 points (or 3 if they had no tricks)
- If closer loses last trick: Cannot go out, opponent wins automatically

### Last Trick Rule
If neither player closes or goes out, whoever wins the last trick wins the hand (1 game point), regardless of card points.

## Important Restrictions

- **No first-trick marriages:** Non-dealer cannot declare a marriage when leading to the first trick (must win a trick first)
- **Cannot close with 2 cards left:** Talon cannot be closed when only the face-up trump and one face-down card remain
- **No going out after losing:** You cannot declare 66 immediately after losing a trick

## Winning the Game

The first player to reduce their game points from 7 to 0 (or below) wins the overall game.

## Strategy Tips

- **Count everything:** Track your points, opponent's points, and sure points if you close
- **Marriage value:** Kings and Queens are powerful but risky to hold too long
- **Closing timing:** Close when you have a sure or likely 66 points
- **Aces and Tens:** Worth lots of points but vulnerable in the open phase
- **Trump control:** Building trump strength often sets up a successful close
- **Comeback potential:** Bold closes and penalties create dramatic swings—never give up!

## Example Winning Sequence

A player dealt Ace-King-Queen of trumps could:
1. Close the talon immediately
2. Lead the Ace (11 points)
3. Declare royal marriage for 40 points
4. Lead King (4 points) then Queen (3 points)
5. Total: 58 points from own cards + opponent's forced cards ≥ 66
